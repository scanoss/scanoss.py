# Installation
To install (from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/scanoss)), please run:
```bash
pip3 install scanoss
```

## Usage
The package can be run from the command line, or consumed from another Python script.

For more details, please look at [PACKAGE.md](PACKAGE.md).

## Container Usage
To leverage the CLI from within a container, please look at [GHCR.md](GHCR.md).

## Development
Before starting with development of this project, please read our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Requirements
Python 3.9 or higher.

The dependencies can be found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and [requirements-dev.txt](requirements-dev.txt) files.

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To enable dependency scanning, an extra tool is required: scancode-toolkit
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-scancode.txt
```

### Devcontainer Setup
To simplify the development environment setup, a devcontainer configuration is provided. This allows you to develop inside a containerized environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed.

To use the devcontainer setup:
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
4. Run 
```bash
cp .devcontainer/devcontainer.example.json .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
``` 
5. Update the `devcontainer.json` file with the desired settings.
6. When prompted, reopen the project in the container.

This will build the container defined in the `.devcontainer` folder and open a new Visual Studio Code window connected to the container.

### Package Development
More details on Python packaging/distribution can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/overview/), [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/), and [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/#using-test-pypi).

It is good practice to set up a Virtual Env ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) to isolate and simplify development/testing.
If using PyCharm, please follow [these instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html).

In order to develop/test a Python package, it is necessary to register the package locally. This can be done using the following command:
```bash
python3 setup.py develop --user
```
There is also a [Makefile](Makefile) in the repository, which provide helpers to achieve this:
```bash
make dev_setup
```
The client now makes use of REST & gRPC. For gRPC specific environment variables please look [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/environment_variables.md).

### Package Deployment
Packaging the library for deployment is done using [setup](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html).

#### Versioning
The version of the package is defined in the [scanoss init](src/scanoss/__init__.py) file. Please update this version before packaging/releasing an update.

#### Packaging
To package the library, please run:
```bash
make dist
```

#### Deployment
This project uses [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to upload packages to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org).
In order to run twine, a user needs to be registered with both [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
Details for using TestPyPI can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi) and PyPI [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi).

Once the credentials have been stored in $HOME/.pypirc, the following command can be run:
```bash
make publish_test
```
This will deploy the package to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/scanoss). Run some tests to verify everything is ok.

Then deploy to prod:
```bash
make publish
```
This will deploy the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scanoss).

The package will then be available to install using:
```bash
pip3 install scanoss
```
